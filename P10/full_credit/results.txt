QUESTION 1: Which value of slices did you select for your machine to solve the polynomial with 1 thread with at least a 30 second runtime: 
129000000

QUESTION 2: Provide the output of ``time polyb nn`` (or the improved version in the lecture video, if you prefer) for the following values of nn threads shown below:

Example Timing:

real	0m22.551s
user	0m22.524s
sys	0m0.012s


YOUR Timing:

Without threads: 
    real	2m10.538s
    user	0m23.961s
    sys 	0m0.000s


With 2 threads:
    real	1m6.561s
    user	0m47.813s
    sys	0m0.008s



With 4 threads:
    real	4m45.349s
    user	1m44.465s
    sys	0m0.024s



With 6 threads:






With 8 threads:






With 12 threads:






With 24 threads:





QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?
Yes, depends on the processor, in most cases it should increase performace till a cetrain level, after that it might be conatant or even slower. 



QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?
Yes, this depends on the CPU's processing power and how many other other programs are running at the same time.
