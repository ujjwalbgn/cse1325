QUESTION 1: Which value of slices did you select for your machine to solve the polynomial with 1 thread with at least a 30 second runtime: 


QUESTION 2: Provide the output of ``time polyb nn`` (or the improved version in the lecture video, if you prefer) for the following values of nn threads shown below:

Example Timing:

real	0m22.551s
user	0m22.524s
sys	0m0.012s


YOUR Timing:

Without threads:




With 2 threads:






With 4 threads:






With 6 threads:






With 8 threads:






With 12 threads:






With 24 threads:





QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?





QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?
