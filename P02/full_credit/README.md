To verify that your terminal program supports ANSI code sequences, first build and run example.cpp using "``make example && ./example``".

Then write your Color class in color.h and color.cpp, as outlined in the PDF. Once it compiles well and you add, commit, and push, test it using "``make test && ./test``". **NOTE: test.cpp will NOT compile until you have completed your Color class!** Again, add, commit, and push.

Finally, write your main function in main.cpp. You can build and run it using "``make color && ./color``". Once that works, add, commit, and push, then move on to the Bonus ("``cd ../bonus``")!
